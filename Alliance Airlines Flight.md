Understanding ' cancellation and refund policies can save you time, 
money, and stress. Non-refundable tickets do not offer refunds on the ticket 
price, but taxes and fees may be refunded. Cancellations after the 24-hour 
grace period incur fees from $200 to $500. Refundable tickets offer a full 
refund if canceled before departure. If Alliance Airlines cancels a flight, 
they provide alternative arrangements or a full refund, potentially including 
compensation for related expenses. The 24-hour cancellation policy allows for 
a full refund within 24 hours of booking if made at least a week before departure. 
Basic Economy tickets are non-refundable but may have taxes and fees refunded within 24 hours. 
Cancellations can be made online or by calling +61(1800)718568. For more details, check 
your ticket's eligibility on the Alliance Airlines website.
