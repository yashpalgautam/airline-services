Virgin Australia's Group Booking policy allows groups of ten or more to travel together for business or leisure. You can book tickets online via the 'Group Travel Request Form' on their website or offline by calling their customer service at +61 (1800) 718 568. Benefits include support from group travel specialists, flexible booking options, and competitive prices. Keep in mind that all group members must fly and stay together, and changes to the booking may affect the entire group. Virgin Australia offers a seamless booking experience with various amenities to ensure a stress-free group journey.
