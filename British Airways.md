British Airways' Name Change Policy provides flexibility for passengers 
needing to adjust their booking details. Minor typographical errors (up to three characters) 
can be corrected easily online or via customer service at +44(800)3686373. For major name 
changes, such as those due to marriage or legal reasons, official documentation is required. 
Tickets are non-transferable, meaning name changes cannot involve swapp0-$250 for significant 
updates. Changes can be made online through the 'Manage My Booking' section oring passengers. 
Fees apply for corrections, ranging from minor charges for small changes to $6 by customer service. 
Refer to British Airways' website or contact their support for detailed assistance.
